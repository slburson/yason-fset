YASON-FSet
==========

This is a fork of [YASON](https://github.com/phmarek/yason) that parses
into FSet seqs and maps, and can write those types also.

[JFon](https://github.com/djha-skin/jfon) is probably a better choice.
See [Sabra Colleton's in-depth review of JSON libraries for
CL](https://sabracrolleton.github.io/json-review).
